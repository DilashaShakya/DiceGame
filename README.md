🎲 Dice Game 
📌 Overview

This is a simple interactive Dice Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Each time the page is refreshed (or the dice are rolled), two dice generate random values between 1 and 6. The game then compares the values and announces the winner.

🚩 Player 1 wins if Dice 1 is higher

🚩 Player 2 wins if Dice 2 is higher

🤝 Draw if both dice show the same number
